# Important stuff
- Rust syntax
- immutability by default: is this a good idea?
  - How different languages deal with const
- Basic types: i64, &str and its friends, -> Struct, Tuple build everything that isnt that
- no NULL! YAAAAAY
- no Exceptions! YAAAY (sorta)
- Writing a program vs writing a robust program

# Workshops
- a place for us to discuss things
- We are allowed to get distracted
- We should be working on the workshop though - lab stuff is if we have time for it
- Workshop today assumes you have started working on picasso

- We will think about what good patterns are easier in rust vs other languages while running this excersise
