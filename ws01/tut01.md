# Hi!

I am Peter, your co-tutor! My other co-tutor is Kaiqi!
- graduated, working 
- Did a bit of rust
- crazy enough to build a webapp with it (with a cool group)
- https://syphon-frontend-ugan2hyxwq-ts.a.run.app/

# Important stuff
- Rust syntax
- immutability by default: is this a good idea?
  - How different languages deal with const
- Basic types: i64, &str and its friends, -> Struct, Tuple build everything that isn't that
- no NULL! What is bad about this?
- no Exceptions! YAAAY (sorta) What is bad about this?
- Writing a program vs writing a robust program
 - how does rust help us with that so far?
 - how does it hinder us?

# Workshops
- a place for us to discuss things
- We are allowed to get distracted
- We should be working on the workshop though - lab stuff is if we have time for it
- Workshop today assumes you have started working on picasso

- We will think about what good patterns are easier in rust vs other languages while running this excersise
